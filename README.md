MicroPython hardware diagnostics for the **Waveshare ESP32-P4-NANO** — eight
self-contained tests (WiFi, Ethernet, CPU/memory/flash, microSD, I2C,
sleep/wake, audio, GPIO), each with a one-shot report and an interactive menu.
Every peripheral is its own package; `main.py` is a top-level selector.

> **Board-specific.** Pin maps and config target the **ESP32-P4-NANO**. Other
> ESP32-P4 boards differ — edit the pin constants at the top of each
> `*/diag.py`. Pins are sourced from Waveshare's schematic and examples (cited
> per section).

## Why I built this

I bought the ESP32-P4-NANO excited by its specs — and then spent days fighting
it. A brand-new board paired with a bleeding-edge MicroPython build is a rough
place to start: scattered pin maps, a WiFi co-processor reached over SDIO, a
microSD slot that only works on a preview firmware, half-documented peripherals,
and error messages that tell you nothing about *which* of the dozen new things
just broke. Every "hello world" turned into an afternoon of guessing whether the
fault was my wiring, my firmware, or the chip.

I wrote these tests so the next person doesn't have to. Each one answers a single
honest question — *does the WiFi work? does the SD card mount? does audio play?* —
with a clear pass/fail report instead of a stack trace. Flash the firmware, run
the menu, and within minutes you know exactly what's alive on your board and what
needs attention. It's the toolkit I wish I'd had on day one.

There's a second reason these tests exist: they double as **worked examples**. If
you're new to MicroPython or to this board, don't just run them — read them. Each
`*/diag.py` is a small, self-contained, heavily-commented walkthrough of how to
actually talk to one peripheral: the right pins, the correct config kwargs, how to
open and close the device, and what a healthy result looks like. Want to scan an
I2C bus, mount the SD card, play a tone, or bring up WiFi in your own project?
Open the matching file, copy the dozen lines that matter, and adapt. They're meant
to be stolen from.

If it saves you even one of those lost afternoons, it did its job. Issues, fixes,
and pin maps for other ESP32-P4 boards are very welcome — pay it forward. 🙂

### Bugs I hit (and what I did about them)

A few of the walls I ran into, in case you're staring at the same error:

- **microSD timed out on stock firmware (`ESP_ERR_TIMEOUT`).** The slot's LDO
  power rail never came up, because the `ldo=` kwarg that drives it didn't exist
  until MicroPython commit `dc44bdbac` (2026-04-02, see
  [issue #18984](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/issues/18984)). Older
  builds reject the kwarg outright (`extra keyword arguments given`). **Fix:**
  flash `v1.29.0-preview` or newer. **Workaround in code:** `sdcard/diag.py`
  detects the old firmware and prints a plain-English message instead of a cryptic
  timeout, so you know it's the firmware and not your card or wiring.
- **WiFi and microSD fought each other.** WiFi on the P4-NANO runs on the onboard
  ESP32-C6 over the esp-hosted link, which a plain `ESP32_GENERIC_P4` master build
  may not include — so chasing the microSD fix by flashing master can *lose* WiFi.
  **Workaround:** cherry-pick the three SD commits onto the Waveshare/vendor source
  that already wires up the C6, rather than flashing stock master. Full recipe in
  [`firmware/BUILD.md`](firmware/BUILD.md).
- **Guessing which new thing was broken.** With a new board *and* new firmware,
  any failure could be wiring, firmware, or silicon. **Fix:** the whole point of
  this repo — each test isolates one peripheral and reports a clear pass/fail, so
  you stop guessing.

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. Clone this repo.
git clone https://github.com/Tangerino/micropython-p4-test-suite.git
cd micropython-p4-test-suite

# 2. Flash MicroPython for the ESP32-P4 (>= v1.29.0-preview, C6_WIFI variant).
#    microSD needs this; every other test also runs on older builds.
#    See firmware/BUILD.md (download a prebuilt image or build your own).

# 3. Point at your board and set WiFi credentials.
export PORT=/dev/tty.usbmodemXXXX     # your serial port (or edit deploy.sh)
cp secrets_example.py secrets.py      # then edit WIFI_SSID / WIFI_PASSWORD

# 4. Deploy and run.
./deploy.sh             # upload everything + open the interactive menu
./deploy.sh --system    # ...or a one-shot report for a single test
./deploy.sh --help      # all options
```

## Requirements

### Hardware
- **Waveshare ESP32-P4-NANO** (ESP32-P4, rev v1.3, dual-core RISC-V @ 400 MHz,
  PSRAM, 16 MB flash)
- **ESP32-C6** WiFi co-processor on-board, linked to the P4 over **SDIO**
  (esp-hosted) — GPIO 18/19/14/15/16/17 (+54 reset)
- **IP101 Ethernet PHY** (RMII) — see the pin table below
- **microSD** slot (SDIO 3.0), IO powered by the P4 **on-chip LDO channel 4**
- **I2C** header (default SDA=GPIO7, SCL=GPIO8)
- **ES8311** audio codec (I2C `0x18`) + **NS4150B** speaker amplifier (I2S)
- No user-controllable LED (power indicator only) — the GPIO test targets any pin
- For tests that need it: an Ethernet cable, a FAT-formatted microSD card, and
  an I2C device

### Software / firmware
- **MicroPython for ESP32-P4**, `C6_WIFI` variant (includes the ESP32-C6
  hosted-WiFi support).
- **microSD requires ≥ `v1.29.0-preview` (2026-05-29)** — or any build from
  MicroPython master ≥ commit `dc44bdbac` (2026-04-02), which added the P4
  `machine.SDCard` `ldo`/`cmd`/`data` kwargs. Older builds (e.g. the stock
  `v1.28.0`) can run every other test but **cannot drive the SD slot**.
- **Verified on:** `MicroPython v1.29.0-preview.337.g44a569b637 (2026-05-29)`,
  `ESP32_GENERIC_P4-C6_WIFI`, ESP32-P4 rev v1.3. microSD confirmed mounting +
  benchmarking on this build; the other areas were exercised on-device during
  development (WiFi, System, I2C) or are ready to run (Ethernet needs a cable,
  Sleep's deep-sleep path reboots the board).

### Host tooling
- [`mpremote`](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/mpremote.html)
  (upload + run) and `esptool` ≥ v5 (only for flashing firmware).
- [`ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for formatting/linting (`ruff format .`,
  `ruff check .`) — config in `ruff.toml` (single-quote strings).

See [`firmware/BUILD.md`](firmware/BUILD.md) to flash the prebuilt image or
build your own.

New hardware goes in a sibling package (e.g. `i2c/`, `sensors/`): add it to
`PKGS` in `deploy.sh` and a line to the selector in `main.py`.

## Tests

| # | Test | Package | Checks | One-shot |
|---|------|---------|--------|----------|
| 1 | WiFi | `wifi/` | scan, connect, link/RSSI, monitor, ping, power, speedtest | `--wifi` |
| 2 | Ethernet | `eth/` | IP101 link + DHCP, connectivity, ping, speedtest | `--eth` |
| 3 | System | `system/` | CPU bench, heap/PSRAM, flash R/W, uptime, reset cause | `--system` |
| 4 | microSD | `sdcard/` | SDMMC mount, capacity, R/W speed (needs ≥ v1.29 fw) | `--sd` |

## Deploy

`deploy.sh` wraps `mpremote` (set `PORT` or edit the default at the top):

```sh
./deploy.sh           # upload, reset, open the interactive menu (REPL)
./deploy.sh --wifi    # upload, then WiFi connect + one-shot report
./deploy.sh --eth     # upload, then Ethernet up + one-shot report
./deploy.sh --system  # upload, then CPU/memory/flash one-shot report
./deploy.sh --sd      # upload, then microSD mount + speed one-shot report
./deploy.sh --i2c     # upload, then I2C bus scan
./deploy.sh --sleep   # upload, then sleep info + light-sleep test
./deploy.sh --audio   # upload, then ES8311 probe + a test tone
./deploy.sh --gpio    # upload, then GPIO test summary
./deploy.sh --serial  # upload, then 4-UART loopback + max-baud sweep
./deploy.sh --ble     # upload, then BLE availability probe + scan
./deploy.sh --thread  # upload, then threading + message-passing + perf report
./deploy.sh --help    # all options
```

Manual equivalent (what `deploy.sh` does — copy the root files, `secrets.py`,
and every package directory, then open the REPL):

```sh
mpremote connect $PORT \
  fs cp main.py :main.py + fs cp netutils.py :netutils.py + fs cp secrets.py :secrets.py \
  + fs cp -r wifi eth system sdcard i2c sleep audio gpio :
mpremote connect $PORT repl
```

## System tests (CPU / memory / flash)

```python
from system import SystemDiagnostics
s = SystemDiagnostics()
s.report()            # board info + CPU + memory + flash
s.cpu()               # freq + int/float benchmark (+ MCU temp if available)
s.cpu(set_mhz=360)    # change core frequency, then benchmark
s.memory()            # heap free/used + largest block + fragmentation
s.flash()             # FS usage + write/read throughput (64 KB temp file)
s.info()              # uname, freq, unique id, flash size
```

The flash test writes and reads a small temp file (`/_flash_test.bin`,
default 64 KB) and deletes it — minimal wear.

## microSD (SDMMC)

Pins (ESP32-P4-NANO, 4-bit SDMMC): `CLK=43 CMD=44 D0=39 D1=40 D2=41 D3=42`.
Edit the constants at the top of `sdcard/diag.py` for other variants.

```python
from sdcard import SDCardDiagnostics
sd = SDCardDiagnostics()
sd.report()       # mount + capacity/usage + write/read speed
sd.mount(); sd.info(); sd.speed(); sd.umount()
```

The speed test writes/reads `/sd/_sdtest.bin` (default 512 KB) and removes it.
Card must be inserted and FAT-formatted.

### Config (native SDMMC slot 0 + on-chip LDO)

Native SDMMC **slot 0** (SDIO 3.0), CLK=43 CMD=44 D0-3=39-42, and — crucially —
the SD card IO is powered by the P4's **on-chip LDO channel 4**. MicroPython's
SDMMC kwargs are `sck`(=CLK), `cmd`, `data` (tuple of D0..), and `ldo`:

```python
machine.SDCard(slot=0, width=4, sck=Pin(43), cmd=Pin(44),
               data=(Pin(39), Pin(40), Pin(41), Pin(42)), ldo=4)
```

These values come from Waveshare's
[`06_sdmmc` ESP-IDF example](https://github.com/waveshareteam/ESP32-P4-Platform/tree/main/examples/esp-idf/06_sdmmc)
(`Kconfig.projbuild`: P4 CLK=43/CMD=44/D0-3=39-42, `SD_PWR_CTRL_LDO_IO_ID=4`).

> ✅ **Verified working** on `v1.29.0-preview.337` (`C6_WIFI`): mounts on the
> first config, e.g. a 256 MB card → `Capacity 255.7 MB`, write ≈ 67 KB/s, read
> ≈ 1065 KB/s in 4-bit mode.
>
> ⚠️ **Firmware requirement.** The `ldo`/`cmd`/`data` kwargs (which power and
> drive the slot) were added to MicroPython master in March–April 2026:
> `a8ba8fab3` (LDO power ctrl), `e57e52218` (configurable slot), **`dc44bdbac`**
> (2026-04-02, the `ldo=` kwarg). Builds older than that — e.g. the stock
> `v1.28.0` — reject those kwargs (`extra keyword arguments given`), so the SD
> slot gets no LDO power and times out (`ESP_ERR_TIMEOUT`). `sdcard/diag.py`
> uses the correct config and **detects old firmware** with a clear message.
> Flash ≥ `v1.29.0-preview` (see [`firmware/BUILD.md`](firmware/BUILD.md)) and
> the SD test works **unchanged**.
> Refs: [`machine.SDCard` docs](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/machine.SDCard.html),
> [issue #18984](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/issues/18984).

## I2C bus scan

Default pins (ESP32-P4-NANO): `SDA=GPIO7 SCL=GPIO8`.

```python
from i2c import I2CDiagnostics
I2CDiagnostics().scan()                      # default pins, 400 kHz
I2CDiagnostics(sda=7, scl=8, freq=100000).scan()
```

Reports each responding 7-bit address with a best-guess device name (a hit
only means *something* answered — confirm against your wiring). Needs pull-ups
on SDA/SCL.

## Sleep / wake

```python
from sleep import SleepDiagnostics
s = SleepDiagnostics()
s.info()              # reset cause + wake reason + RTC-memory marker
s.light_sleep(2000)   # light sleep 2 s, resumes in place, reports elapsed
s.deep_sleep(5)       # marker + deep sleep 5 s -> REBOOT (does not return)
```

**Light sleep** resumes execution where it left off. **Deep sleep reboots the
chip** on wake, dropping the serial/REPL link — reconnect after the sleep
interval. The test stashes a marker in RTC memory before sleeping; on the next
boot `main.py` calls `sleep.check_wake()`, which detects the marker, confirms
`reset_cause == DEEPSLEEP_RESET`, and prints how long the board was out. Deep
sleep is interactive-only (menu option 3, with a confirm) since it reboots.

## Audio / speaker (ES8311 + NS4150B)

The P4-NANO has an **ES8311** mono codec (I2C `0x18`) driving an **NS4150B**
speaker amplifier. Pins (from Waveshare's `07_I2SCodec` example):

| Signal | GPIO |
|--------|------|
| Codec I2C (SDA / SCL) | 7 / 8 |
| Amp enable (NS4150B) | 53 |
| I2S MCLK / BCLK / WS / DOUT / DIN | 13 / 12 / 10 / 9 / 11 |

```python
from audio import AudioDiagnostics
a = AudioDiagnostics()
a.probe()                       # confirm ES8311 chip ID (0x83 0x11) over I2C
a.tone(440, 2)                  # 440 Hz sine, 2 s (default vol 90, amp 28000)
a.tone(440, 2, volume=100, amp=32000)   # max level
a.ring(4)                       # telephone ring: NA ringback 440+480 Hz
a.ring(2, off_ms=4000)          # true cadence (2 s on / 4 s off)
a.song('ode')                   # by name: ode/twinkle/scale/birthday/mario
a.song(2)                       # ...or by number (a.song_names() lists them)
a.beep()                        # short 1 kHz beep
```

`song()` plays a built-in tune (`ode`, `twinkle`, `scale`, `birthday`, `mario`)
as a note sequence; `melody([(note, ms), ...])` plays your own — notes are
`NOTES` keys (`'C4'`, `'A4'`, …) or raw Hz, with a short per-note fade to avoid
clicks.

`ring()` plays the North American ringback (dual-tone 440+480 Hz) with a
configurable on/off cadence (default 2 s on / 2 s off so a test is quick; pass
`off_ms=4000` for the real cadence).

Two software gain stages: `amp` (digital sine amplitude, 0–32767 — a pure sine
won't clip at full scale) and `volume` (ES8311 DAC register `0x32`, 0–100%).
The NS4150B amplifier gain is fixed in hardware.

MicroPython's `machine.I2S` does **not** emit MCLK, so the codec clock is
generated on GPIO13 with **PWM** (rate×256). The ES8311 register init table is
adapted from the MIT-licensed
[MicroPython ES8311 driver by raptor09010](https://github.com/raptor09010/Micropython-ES8311-Library).
`probe()` is verified (`ES8311 OK`); `tone()` runs the full
codec→I2S→amp path.

## GPIO (generic blink / read)

The P4-NANO has **no documented user LED** (only a power indicator), so this is
a generic pin tool — wire an LED+resistor or a meter to any header pin.

```python
from gpio import GPIODiagnostics
g = GPIODiagnostics()
g.blink(2, count=10, period_ms=200)   # blink GPIO2
g.high(2); g.low(2); g.read(2, pull='up')
```

## Serial ports (UART loopback)

A pure-hardware UART test — **no protocol**. Jumper **TX↔RX** on each port and
the `serial` test loops a pattern through all 4 ports concurrently, verifies
it, and **sweeps baud to find the max each port passes**. Full pin map, jumper
table, and header diagram are in **[`docs/SERIAL.md`](docs/SERIAL.md)**.

```python
from serial import probe, echo, max_speed, report, monitor
probe()               # which UART controllers (0..5) the firmware exposes
report()              # probe + concurrent echo @ 921600 + per-port max-baud sweep
echo(2000000)         # all 4 ports at one baud
max_speed()           # highest passing baud per port
monitor()             # live ON/off-line per port as you fit/remove jumpers
```

The ESP32-P4 has **5 UART controllers** (UART0–4); the bench uses **UART1–4**
and **reserves UART0** (the boot/console UART) to avoid future conflicts — so
`GPIO37/38` stay free. Jumper: `20↔21`, `23↔22`, `32↔33`, `26↔27`. A `FAIL`
just means that port's jumper is missing; `probe()` confirms controller
availability with no jumpers. (UART3 uses `32/33` because `GPIO24/25` are the
USB-Serial-JTAG pins and can't be a UART.) One-shot: `./deploy.sh --serial`.

## BLE (via the ESP32-C6)

The P4 has no radio — BLE comes from the **ESP32-C6 over the esp-hosted link**.
Whether MicroPython can use it depends on the build routing BLE/HCI through the
hosted transport, which the **`C6_WIFI`** image may not do. The `ble` test
**probes that first**, then scans/advertises if BLE is live.

```python
from ble import BLEDiagnostics
b = BLEDiagnostics()
b.probe()                 # is BLE available on this firmware?
b.scan(5000)              # list nearby BLE advertisers (addr, RSSI, name)
b.advertise('P4-TEST')    # advertise a beacon (find it in a phone BLE app)
```

`probe()` reports one of:
- `bluetooth module: NOT present` → BLE isn't compiled into this build.
- `BLE controller: FAILED to activate` → module present, but the hosted C6 link
  doesn't bridge BLE on this firmware.
- `BLE controller: ACTIVE` → BLE works; scan/advertise are usable.

One-shot: `./deploy.sh --ble`.

## Threads (dual-core)

The P4 has **two RISC-V cores**, and MicroPython exposes `_thread` — but note
the ESP32 port pins **all** Python (the interpreter task *and* every `_thread`)
to **core 1 only** (`MP_TASK_COREID`); core 0 is reserved for the ESP-IDF
WiFi/BLE system tasks. So your threads share one core, and a global VM lock (a
GIL) serialises bytecode on top of that. This test spawns workers, checks lock
correctness, measures message-passing throughput, and compares 1- vs 2-thread
CPU work.

```python
from thread import ThreadDiagnostics
t = ThreadDiagnostics()
t.spawn(4)           # start 4 workers, confirm all ran
t.race(200000)       # shared counter: unlocked (racy) vs locked (exact)
t.messaging(5000)    # producer->consumer throughput + latency
t.performance()      # 1-thread vs 2-thread CPU work
```

What the bench actually shows on the P4:

- **Message passing works well** — a lock-guarded mailbox sustains ~11k msg/s
  with ~130 µs latency. Threads are great for I/O-bound concurrency and IPC.
- **CPU-bound Python does NOT parallelise** — all Python runs on one core and a
  GIL serialises bytecode. Splitting math across 2 threads is *slower* than 1
  (GIL handoffs + context switches on the same core), so `performance()` reports
  well under 1× — that result is **correct/expected**, not a bug.
- **Contended `lock.acquire()` costs ~one RTOS tick** here, so heavy
  fine-grained locking is expensive (the lock sub-test uses a small count).
- For real CPU parallelism use native code (`@micropython.viper` / C);
  `_thread` buys you concurrency, not compute throughput.

### `_thread` vs `asyncio`

Because threads give **no** parallelism here (one core + GIL), `asyncio` is the
better default for concurrency: no GIL-handoff/context-switch overhead, no data
races (cooperative single-thread, so no locks needed), lower RAM (no separate
per-thread stack), and deterministic scheduling at `await` points. Reach for
`_thread` only when you must run a *blocking* call you can't make async (one
that releases the GIL while blocked) or a library only offers blocking APIs —
and even then it's concurrency, not speedup.

One-shot: `./deploy.sh --thread`.

## USB / USB host

The P4 has **two USB interfaces**:

| Interface | Pins | Role |
|-----------|------|------|
| USB-Serial-JTAG (Full-Speed) | **GPIO24 / 25** (fixed) | console / flashing / the REPL link |
| USB 2.0 OTG **High-Speed** | **dedicated USB D+/D- pads** (not the GPIO matrix) | OTG host/device port |

- **No GPIO/UART conflict:** the JTAG console pins (24/25) are reserved — the
  serial test deliberately avoids them (UART3 is on 32/33) — and the OTG-HS data
  lines aren't GPIO at all. Console + USB-OTG + the 4 UARTs all coexist.
- **USB host is not usable from MicroPython** on the P4 (`machine.USBHost` doesn't
  exist; `machine.USBDevice` doesn't cover the P4). The OTG-HS host port (e.g. to
  read USB-serial / USB-to-RS485 dongles, a flash drive, or a keyboard) needs
  **ESP-IDF (C)** or **Arduino-ESP32** (`EspUsbHost`). ESP-IDF's
  `usb_host_cdc_acm` + VCP drivers (FTDI/CH34x/CP210x) and a USB hub handle
  multiple USB-serial adapters at once.
- **VBUS:** the P4 doesn't internally source 5 V — bus-powered USB devices need an
  external 5 V→VBUS path on the host port.

There is therefore **no MicroPython "USB host" test** in this bench; the
USB-Serial-JTAG port is implicitly proven by `mpremote` connecting over it. Full
design analysis (4 UARTs + USB-to-RS485, conflicts, VBUS, firmware gate) is in
[`docs/P4-MIGRATION.md`](docs/P4-MIGRATION.md).

## Ethernet pin map (ESP32-P4-NANO, IP101 PHY)

Verified against the Waveshare wiki and ESPHome board config. Only the
management/clock pins are configurable from `network.LAN()`; the RMII **data**
pins are fixed by the board wiring and the firmware EMAC config.

| Signal | GPIO | Settable in `network.LAN`? |
|--------|-----:|----------------------------|
| MDC | 31 | yes (`mdc`) |
| MDIO | 52 | yes (`mdio`) |
| PHY power / reset | 51 | yes (`power`) |
| RMII REF_CLK (50 MHz, **input** to P4) | 50 | yes (`ref_clk`, `ref_clk_mode=Pin.IN`) |
| TXD0 / TXD1 | 34 / 35 | no (fixed) |
| RXD0 / RXD1 | 30 / 29 | no (fixed) |
| TX_EN | 49 | no (fixed) |
| CRS_DV | 28 | no (fixed) |

PHY address = `1`. Edit the constants at the top of `eth/diag.py` for other
board variants. If MDC/MDIO/power/clk are correct but the link never comes up,
the firmware build's RMII **data**-pin mapping doesn't match this board.

```python
from eth import EthernetDiagnostics
e = EthernetDiagnostics()
e.up()            # bring link up + DHCP
e.report()        # status, IP, connectivity, ping
e.ifconfig()
e.ping('8.8.8.8')
e.down()
```

## Single entry point

On boot the board runs `main.py`, the **top-level selector** (WiFi / Ethernet /
System / microSD / I2C / Sleep / Audio / GPIO). This is what greets you over the
serial console:

```text
==== ESP32-P4 Hardware Tests ====
 1) WiFi  (ESP32-C6, hosted RPC)
 2) Ethernet (IP101 PHY, RMII)
 3) System (CPU / memory / flash)
 4) microSD (SDMMC)
 5) I2C bus scan
 6) Sleep / wake
 7) Audio (ES8311 speaker)
 8) GPIO (blink/read any pin)
 9) Serial loopback (4 UARTs, HW)
10) BLE (ESP32-C6, hosted)
11) Threads (dual-core, IPC, perf)
 0) Exit
Choose:
```

Each package also exposes its own menu and class for direct REPL use:

```python
import system
system.main()          # that package's menu; returns its object so it stays usable
```

## Credentials (secrets.py)

WiFi credentials live in `secrets.py`, which is **gitignored** (never
committed). Create it from the template:

```sh
cp secrets_example.py secrets.py     # then edit WIFI_SSID / WIFI_PASSWORD
```

`deploy.sh` uploads `secrets.py` to the board when present; `wifi/diag.py`
reads `WIFI_SSID` / `WIFI_PASSWORD` from it for `connect()`'s defaults. If
`secrets.py` is absent the defaults are blank — pass credentials explicitly:
`d.connect('ssid', 'pw')`.

## WiFi (REPL)

```python
from wifi import WiFiDiagnostics
d = WiFiDiagnostics()

d.report()                # full one-shot: scan, power, link, connectivity, ping
d.scan()                  # list networks (sorted by signal)
d.connect()               # join with default creds (blocks until GOT_IP/timeout)
d.connect('ssid', 'pw')   # ...or explicit creds
d.link()                  # current association + RSSI
d.ifconfig()              # IP / netmask / gateway / DNS
d.connectivity()          # DNS resolution + internet reachability
d.ping('8.8.8.8')         # ICMP echo, RTT min/avg/max + loss%
d.monitor()               # live RSSI bar graph (Ctrl-C to stop)
d.monitor(count=10)       # ...or a fixed number of samples
d.power()                 # read power-save mode + TX power
d.power(txpower=15)       # set TX power (dBm)
d.disconnect()
```

## Notes

- The `W (xxxxx) rpc_rsp: Hosted RPC_Resp ...` lines printed during
  `scan()`/`connect()` come from the esp-hosted transport between the P4 and
  the C6 radio. They are informational, not errors.
- `ping()` uses a raw ICMP socket. If the firmware/lwIP build doesn't permit
  raw sockets it says so — fall back to `tcp_check()` / `connectivity()`, which
  use DNS resolution and a TCP connect to `8.8.8.8:53`.
- Security types are decoded from the ESP-IDF `wifi_auth_mode_t` integer
  returned by `scan()` (e.g. `3` = WPA2-PSK, `7` = WPA2/WPA3-PSK).

## Contributing

Each test is a self-contained package exposing a `*Diagnostics` class and a
`main()` menu. To add one:

1. Create `yourtest/` with `__init__.py` (re-export the class + `main`) and
   `diag.py`.
2. Add `yourtest` to `PKGS` in `deploy.sh` and a line to the selector in
   `main.py`.
3. Cite the source for any board-specific pins (schematic / vendor example).
4. Format and lint before opening a PR:

```sh
ruff format .
ruff check .
```

Issues and PRs welcome — especially pin maps / results for **other ESP32-P4
boards**.
